                FilaMeter is a web app designed to help you efficiently track
                and manage your 3D printer filament spools. It acts as a simple
                yet powerful database for organizing your spools, tracking their
                material type, usage, and storage locationâ€”all from within your
                browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                Built using PouchDB and LocalStorage, FilaMeter prioritizes
                local data storage, meaning your records stay on your device
                without requiring a server. While an internet connection may be
                needed for certain resources, the core functionality runs
                directly in the browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                The app allows you to easily log new spools, update filament
                usage, and add notes for better organization. Each spool entry
                includes fields for filament name, material type, used weight,
                location, and comments, with quick edit and delete actions to
                keep your inventory up to date.
              </p>

                Whether you're managing a few spools or an extensive collection,
                FilaMeter helps you stay organized and in control of your 3D
                printing materials.
